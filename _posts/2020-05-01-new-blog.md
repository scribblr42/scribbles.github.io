Well. Finally got around to putting this old website together.
Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.

This blog includes blogs from my previous blogspot page, and some missing blogs will be 'rewritten' for the new age.

Expect more musings about data and analytics, a smattering of Tableau as well as some data culture related posts.

I'm embarking on a new journey - but more on that very soon..
