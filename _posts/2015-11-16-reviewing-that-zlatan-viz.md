Zlatan Ibrahimovic was always described as an 'enigma' - People weren't sure how good he really was, he scored often but never really exploded, yet still commanded huge transfer fees - But I think since he moved to Paris St-Germain, he's really come into his own - A fact which was highlighted when he became the club's all-time highest goalscorer with 110 goals on the 4th of October 2015.<br /><br />I made a visualisation to celebrate, using TransferMarkt.com as my data source, scraping the data using Import.io and then adding multiple sheets in Excel. Check out the viz below.<br /><br /><script src="https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js" type="text/javascript"></script><br /><div class="tableauPlaceholder" style="height: 1469px; width: 804px;"><noscript><a href='#'><img alt='Dashboard 1 ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Zl&#47;Zlatan110&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class="tableauViz" height="1469" style="display: none;" width="804"><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Zlatan110&#47;Dashboard1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Zl&#47;Zlatan110&#47;Dashboard1&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='showVizHome' value='no' /><param name='showTabs' value='y' /><param name='bootstrapWhenNotified' value='true' /></object></div><br />When I created it, I was quite excitable - it was current, I'd worked hard to get a lot of information on there, and I felt it had a infographic meets visualisation feel to it. Looking at it now, for the purposes of this blog, I think that there's scope for a makeover.<br /><br />Let's talk through it a bit.<br />I kept a black background in order to utilise the gold text, which enabled me to have a 'champion' theme, and I added the image which the PSG Twitter account posted when Zlatan broke the record. Then I added a cumulative goals scored chart, coloured by season with a second overall running total sitting behind - I think this was a mistake, looking back. A simple running total would probably suffice, but I'm still a fan of the information that the tooltips provide.<br /><br />The comparison to Pauleta was supposed to be a bit of context, but I think it's a bit distracting, and takes away from the achievement - Particularly as the website I used to get the data doesn't have the same granularity so therefore doesn't have the same effect.<br /><br />Then the 'radio' chart. I'm super uncertain about this - I wanted to show the games in which Zlatan has scored or assisted a goal, to show his attacking influence and to show games where he had contributed to at least 3 goals. This needs to change. I think it's very hard to read, and there definitely is a better way to visualize this particular datapoint.<br /><br />This was also the first time I had created a scrollable dashboard - one which allows the user to read left to right and scroll to see more - I liked this, but it definitely had it's issues when actually putting the dashboard together in Tableau.<br /><br />All in all, on reflection, I think the aethetics, theme and layout of this visualisation was good - I just think that I need to spent a little bit more time thinking through whether something adds value, the underlying narrative of my story &amp; essentially, what the most important points of the visualisation are.<br /><br />I'll be doing a makeover of this over the coming weeks I think!
