<img height="525" src="https://marginalscribbler.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/4559081470.jpg?w=620" width="640" /><br /><br />So in my <a href="https://marginalscribbler.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/just-for-fun-the-championship-5-a-side-team-1415/" target="_blank">previous post </a>I mentioned an idea I had to choose a&nbsp; 5-a-side team from the Championship in 'FIFA Street' style. After posting the blog, @Owain_Thomas on Twitter suggested I choose a pre-stats and post-stats team.<br /><br />My pre-stats team was;<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Dimi Konstantopolous (GK, Middlesborough);</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Christoph Berra (DEF, Ipswich)</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Matt Ritchie (MID, Bournemouth)--Wes Hoolahan (MID, Norwich)</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Freddie Sears (FWD, Ipswich)</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">Konstantopolous was a great goalkeeper last season from what I saw - Commanding and a giant. Berra, in my eyes, is one of the best defenders in the league, given his positional nous and command of the defensive line (though this, and his aerial ability, are negligible on a 5-a-side pitch). Ritchie and Hoolahan are creative, attacking players - Ritchie being the runner, and Hoolahan a creator. And Freddie Sears is one of the most polished finishers I've seen. I considered Bamford or Wilson for this, as well as Deeney but chose Sears due to my Ipswich bias.</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">So what happened when I started messing around with the numbers?<br /><br />I've made a Tableau Viz of it - and if the embed below doesn't work (again), the link is <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/scribblr.42#!/vizhome/SkyBetChampionship5-a-side/Story1" target="_blank">here</a>.</div><br /><br /><div class="tableauPlaceholder" style="height: 896px; width: 1173px;"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5138343082934398153#"><img alt="Sky Bet Championship 14/155-a-side " height="467" src="https://public.tableau.com/static/images/Sk/SkyBetChampionship5-a-side/Story1/1_rss.png" style="border: none;" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">From this, my amended team would be;</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">David Button (GK, Brentford)</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Adam Smith (DEF, Bournemouth)</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Jon Toral (MID, Brentford)--Tom Ince (MID, Derby)</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Gary Hooper (FWD, Norwich)</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;">Bench; Lee Grant, James Tarvenier, Lewis Dunk, Oliver Norwood, Wes Hoolahan, Matt Ritchie and Odion Ighalo.</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">The Tableau viz is interactive, so feel free to play around and let me know who your team would be. You can also filter by team, search by player (full name!) and compare and contrast. Given the amount of midfielders, the two midfield dashboards (particularly the attacking one) is very busy - so apologies for that. Any ideas on additional metrics (I mention the DangerZone shot conversion in the Forwards tab; this is Goals Scored divided by Total Shots Taken within the penalty &amp; 6-yard box)</div><br /><br /><div style="text-align: left;">Thoughts &amp; feedback as ever, welcome on Twitter @Scribblr_42</div>
