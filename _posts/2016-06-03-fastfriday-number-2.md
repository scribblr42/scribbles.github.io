<div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"><b style="box-sizing: border-box;">Welcome to the second in the&nbsp;</b>#FastFriday<b style="box-sizing: border-box;">&nbsp;series.</b></div><div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;">For context, this is a weekly challenge that Ben Moss, Simona Loffredo and myself will be participating in. The concept is as follows - We have to create a visualisation created from a dataset which we see for the first time&nbsp; when we connect to Tableau. We're starting with a time limit of SIX (6) minutes to create a visualisation with meaning.</div><div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;" /></div><div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"><b style="box-sizing: border-box;">The objective?</b>&nbsp;To learn about interpreting data better. To understand each other's approach when faced with a new data set.</div><div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;">And how well we viz under pressure.</div><div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;">We will screen record and then blog about our experiences.</div><div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"><b style="box-sizing: border-box;">Make sense?</b>&nbsp;Check out my video below (complete with my mutterings while I bu<span style="font-size: 11pt;">ild - again)</span></div><div style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; font-family: calibri; font-size: 11pt; margin: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><br /></span></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" class="YOUTUBE-iframe-video" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/loJ9al-fqDI/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/loJ9al-fqDI?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">God. This one was tough! First of all, huge shout out to Chris Love for providing this week's dataset - It's been a hectic week for me, so I've only just been able to finish and post my effort! (the time is 10:44pm)</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>TIME: </b>6m 5s</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Beginnings</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Once more, the first thing I did was scroll across the data - this is a university data set, showing the rankings worldwide across different metrics. Given the time limit, I was already semi-panicking! I thought about measure names and measure values, as Ben and Simo did last week - my intentions were to create something simple and spend more time on dashboard design... Woops!<br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Looking at the number of universities gave me an idea of the amount of detail (as each row was one uni) but also adding in the year (changing it to a dimension first) - Then the heatmap was good to spot how the data was structured... Were all the universities always in the top 100? Were there others who didn't make it?</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">In my head, I was thinking of what I was going to do. A bump chart, a Top N filter, a slope chart with a highlight parameter... All crossed my mind. But I thought ranking was boring, so ended up using a map - cos maps are cool.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>What shall I do now?</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Given there was no geographical hierarchy, I thought I'd actually create one myself - using Groups. This was what really slowed me down.. The groups were (as I then realised) assigned by the data - in this case the raw latitude and longitudes. This meant that I couldn't simply intuitively add outliers into a group (as I found with the University of Sussex, which was a Null) - After grouping, renaming and being happy, I had not much time left to create something using these groups.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">So I went to my trusted small multiple scatter! I mapped each region by year, and looked at how the teaching scores and research scores a) correlated and b) how they'd changed. This was quite interesting I thought, and the viz itself didn't look awful.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Thoughts</b><br />I did end up spending the last minute or two lamenting my approach to groups, while absentmindedly adding a title and doing some formatting things.&nbsp;</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I attribute this slowness to a semi-frustrating end of the week, as well as the time being half past 10 at night etc etc, excuses excuses. I really enjoy this project, the panic is real - especially when you're running against the clock. It makes me think how much I love the iterative process of Tableau - but in order to work efficiently AND effectively, I think this exercise is a fantastic way of working toward that end.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Check out Ben &amp; Simo's efforts here:</b></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Ben Moss:&nbsp;https://benjnmoss.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/fastfriday-6-minute-vizzes-episode-2/</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Simona Loffredo:&nbsp;https://thevizconnoisseur.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/fastfriday-6-minute-vizzes-2nd-episode/</div>
