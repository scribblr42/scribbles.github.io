# Hi, I'm Ravi
## Tableau Zen Master + Ambassador, Data Visualisation Specialist
A lapsed economist, I enable folks to make sense of data through analytics & visualisation. Currently working for the City Football Group as part of the Global Football team, focussing on Football Intelligence. My role is to grow the analytical ability of the organisation, build out fresh intelligence capabilities and augment existing processes with data-driven insights.
  
Sports analytics (mainly football) is my passion, but I'm also a keen enthusiast in contemporary technology as well as film & media.  

I also podcast at the [Datum](http://datumpodcast.com/) Podcast, and you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scribblr_42/) here.
