<h1>Ravi Mistry.</h1>
A lapsed economist, I do my best to help people make sense of data through analytics & visualisation.
Sports analytics (mainly football) is my passion, but I'm also a keen enthusiast in contemporary technology as well as film & media.
I also podcast at the [Datum](http://datumpodcast.com/) Podcast.
