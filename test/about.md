Hey, I'm Tom Worville.

I'm a `Data Scientist` based in London, UK. I currently work for [Opta](http://optasports.com/) and [OptaPro](http://www.optasportspro.com/).

`#Content` wise I've blogged in the past over at [Medium](https://medium.com/@worville), appeared on the OptaPro [Three At The Back](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/three-at-the-back/id1143073118?mt=2) podcast and used to host the [Analytics FC podcast](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/analytics-fc-podcast/id991610009?mt=2).

You can find a couple of fairly boring code repos on my [GitHub](https://github.com/worville) - I'm more active on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com).
