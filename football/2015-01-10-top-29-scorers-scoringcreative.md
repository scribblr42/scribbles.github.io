<a href="https://marginalscribbler.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-08-at-21-31-38.png"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-171" src="https://marginalscribbler.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/screen-shot-2015-01-08-at-21-31-38.png?" alt="Screen Shot 2015-01-08 at 21.31.38" width="300" height="86" /></a><br /><br />Just data dropping this here, few quick comments;<br /><br /> <strong>Daryl Murphy</strong> of Ipswich leads the way with 17 non-penalty goals and 1 assist - a scoring contribution behind only Hugo Rodallega and Kenwyne Jones, who have more assists that Murphy (DM has played more minutes, registering a goal every 121 minutes, whereas HR Goals per Minutes played is 177 and KJ's is 143)<br /><br /> <strong>Michail Antonio</strong> and <strong>Bakary Sako</strong> love the ball at their feet - both have attemped over 100 dribbles already, with Sako more successful with 57% completed to Antonio's 44%. Both have gotten goals and assists from the wing, leading to admirable scoring contributions of 0.709 for Antonio whilst Sako's 0.378 is fairly average for this division.<br /><br /> <strong>David Cotterill</strong> has been a key figure in Birmingham's very weird season - amongst the bright sparks are also Demarï Gray; but Cotterill's goals (6) and assists (6) as well as being a creative force with 74 key passes (next closest is the equally strong <strong>Grant Leadbitter </strong>with 50, who has enjoyed a great season of penalty scoring - 7 dispatched) the highest in the league.<br /><br /> <strong>Britt Assombalonga</strong> shone initially for Notts Forest after a (relatively) big money move from Peterborough, but has simmered down in recent times. 20 out of 68 shots have been on target, a joint lowest in this list of 29 of (what a coin-ki-dink) 29%. The most accurate shooter/efficient shooter is <strong>Clayton Donaldson</strong>, who's hit the target 90% of the time he's taken a shot (19/21 taken)<br /><br /> Mentions also for <strong>Rudy Gestede</strong> who I am a huge fan of, for the annoyingly consistent <strong>Chris Martin</strong> and also for the surprisingly wasteful <strong>David McGoldrick</strong> who has taken the most shots in this list (85, one more than Daryl Murphy) but has put just 25 on target (29%) (The exact same ratio as Assombalonga) (Worst of all is <strong>Glenn Murray</strong> though, who's loan spell at Reading has now finished - but his 19 shots on target from a possible 65 is huge.)<br /><br />
