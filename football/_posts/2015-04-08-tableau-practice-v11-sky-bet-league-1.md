<a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/scribblr.42#!/vizhome/Messingaround/Dashboard1">https://public.tableau.com/profile/scribblr.42#!/vizhome/Messingaround/Dashboard1</a><a href="https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5138343082934398153#"><img alt="Dashboard 1 " src="https://public.tableau.com/static/images/Me/Messingaround/Dashboard1/1_rss.png" style="border: none;" /></a><br /><br />So I had a mess around with Tableau, both yesterday and today - My first go was after Neil Charles put up his excellent <a href="http://www.wallpaperingfog.co.uk/2015/02/how-to-do-football-analysis-in-tableau.html" target="_blank">"How to.." guide </a>a month or so ago, but I didn't have any real data.<br /><br />And then it struck me, that I had a horde of Sky Bet League 1 and (more extensive, however sketchy) Championship data to mess around with. So I did - And I've ended up with the above very simple dashboard. (Let me know if it works..!)<br /><br />So what I've got is non-penalty goals per 90 on the y-axis and assists per 90 on the x-axis. The size of the bubble indicates the amount of minutes played (Started at a minimum of 700, as to not get any wildcard players with stupid number involved) and the green-white-red gradient indicates age - Which I thought would be quite interesting - Note Lisbie and Akinfenwa.<br /><br />I've also added in a trend-line, with the statistical description from Tableau included as an image on the right, as well as a key. I think there's actually quite a lot you can do with this, so it'll be cool to do a full season breakdown analysis once may comes around - Hopefully with data for each Championship team. But yes, this is a first play around and any feedback, pointers etc. are more than welcome!<br /><br />
