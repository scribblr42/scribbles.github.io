Below, is my narrative on how it was built.</em></strong></p><p>Iron Viz season is well, well, <strong>well</strong> underway. For the first time, Tableau Public are running Iron Viz Europe - Think #TheBigOne, but on a smaller, more concentrated scale.</p><p><br>I entered my first ever Iron Viz for the first feeder this year, looking at National Parks in the UK, but the topic for the inaugural Iron Viz Europe was simple; Europe. Any data, any topic - but it has to have a link to Europe.</p><p><br>Now, there's actually a surprising number of data portals in Europe, and quite a few with good, clean data. I submitted a piece of work I did a few months back on <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/scribblr.42#!/vizhome/IstheEUexpanding/IstheEUexpanding" target="_blank">EU GDP Growth</a>, and following a similar thread, I decided to focus on something based around the EU28 countries.</p><p><br>I'm a semi-regular reader of the Economist, and one article which I read last weekend caught my eye - "<a href="http://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21721242-supporting-ageing-population-would-require-more-high-skilled-immigration" target="_blank">Immigration cannot plug the hole in America‚Äôs budget</a>". Within this, it detailed that America's ageing population would mean greater pressure on the working age folk to take on responsibility + productivity - and to solve this with immigration, I quote..<br></p><blockquote><em>A rough calculation suggests that almost 40m such immigrants would need to arrive immediately in order to fill the hole caused by social-security payments and hospital visits for the over-65s. They would have to be followed by 36m more by 2047‚Äîarrivals that are already baked into budgetary forecasts.</em></blockquote><p>Now this lead to a discussion with my uncle, who quoted something about how fertility rates would have to be maintained around 2.0 to sustain a culture through a generation. Coupled with the article, I wanted to take a look deeper for myself.</p><p><br>For this, I used the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">World Bank Dataportal.</a> This has a whole host of development indicators and macroeconomic data open for use. I took a handful of metrics, and then got to work. Through the #TableauShuffle, and some data exploration in Tableau, I figured what I wanted to show is how much things had changed. The data I had extracted I'd taken from 1984 (as this gave the most complete data for all the EU28 countries) up to 2014/2015 (some metrics didn't have data for 2015). Small multiple with text was my original idea, and I very quickly had a rough visual in my head of what I wanted to do.</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em; text-align: left;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iKGWAqfL44M/WQcmN6SAmeI/AAAAAAAABV8/bGpmZUIsFuIRpyHHxLMvXK7uUpZDLOjZwCLcB/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-01%2Bat%2B13.12.12.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iKGWAqfL44M/WQcmN6SAmeI/AAAAAAAABV8/bGpmZUIsFuIRpyHHxLMvXK7uUpZDLOjZwCLcB/s320/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-05-01%2Bat%2B13.12.12.png" data-image-align="left" data-image-caption="A calculations I use often, but can never remember." width="900" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">A calculations I use often, but can never remember.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>First, I thought of using the "Columns/Rows" calculations (which I save in my OneNote cos I can never memorise it) [For reference; C<strong>olumn Divider:</strong> (index()-1)%(round(sqrt(size()))) <strong>Row Divider:</strong> int( (index()-1)/(round(sqrt(size())))) - then make both discrete dimensions and have them compute using the dimension you want to split into small multiples).</p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sSFIJVETWfo/WQcnUYn5kSI/AAAAAAAABWI/H7gt_UQT6eYe70sNDLK8M5NZzZro2PBhwCLcB/s1600/1493126722194.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sSFIJVETWfo/WQcnUYn5kSI/AAAAAAAABWI/H7gt_UQT6eYe70sNDLK8M5NZzZro2PBhwCLcB/s320/1493126722194.png" data-image-align="right" data-image-caption="Hmm..

So I took 2 unprecedented steps;</p><p><br></p><ol><li>I decided to use floating containers.</li><li>I decided to create a long form dashboard.</li></ol><p>I've been (perhaps fairly publicly?) against long-form visualisations, mainly out of laziness and effort placed on the reader. I think it's a difficult skill to build out a long-form viz, while also maintaining a strong rhythm - particularly balancing an emphasis on design vs and emphasis on information.</p><p><br></p><p>Nonetheless; I wanted to do small-multiples here, and I wanted to tell a story. So I began designing my dashboard and working out exactly how long my dashboard should be, how many elements I want and how to lay it out. The tools I used for this were; Microsoft Excel to plot where 28 countries would sit, and how much space a title, a line chart and stacked bar would need.</p><p><br></p><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wr2AymgYVj8/WQcnri76QPI/AAAAAAAABWM/KnDlRHPBpQE6ub1yUA_acRIcqI59QHBiwCLcB/s1600/1493289182099.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wr2AymgYVj8/WQcnri76QPI/AAAAAAAABWM/KnDlRHPBpQE6ub1yUA_acRIcqI59QHBiwCLcB/s320/1493289182099.png" data-image-align="middle" data-image-caption="How to scientifically figure out what goes where on a floating container dashboard" width="498" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">How to scientifically figure out what goes where on a floating container dashboard</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Magical.</strong></p><p>Now here's the interesting part. What I started with is an idea where I had the EU28 average in the middle, and all the countries around it. But this was waaaay too fiddly, and I wouldn't be able to use one y-axis as I can with this finished product. Below, you can see what I started off with as my first pass.</p><p><br></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ssMZaMaNVZo/WQcokHYkJ2I/AAAAAAAABWk/DWiCNDzrMPA0OBXw-RmCbqmMWRXrnQx9gCLcB/s1600/IMG_3450.PNG"><img src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ssMZaMaNVZo/WQcokHYkJ2I/AAAAAAAABWk/DWiCNDzrMPA0OBXw-RmCbqmMWRXrnQx9gCLcB/s320/IMG_3450.PNG" width="1004" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></div><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>As things moved on a little, I found that I needed a touch more space in my visualisation. So, given I've plotted the exact position of my containers, said exactly the height, width and layout - These should all be fine right?</p><p>Wrong. Tableau shifts all these down - I've added it to the list of questions I have when I grab a dev at the Tableau Conference in Vegas this year. That, and a font issue I'll cover shortly.</p><p><br></p><p>As you can see, layout, colour scheme and background have all changed - and this is thanks to the waves of feedback I got; not only from those in the Data School, the Information Lab (UK and beyond!) but also from members of the Tableau Community. Y'all rock. Thank you!</p><p><br></p><p>The final touches for me was to clean up the "how to read" legend - Ben Moss was a big help here by suggesting I combine the image I'd mocked up with the EU average visualisation, thus leaving me with more space to play - and the final three panels at the bottom. I called these "quick hits" - thought they're more like little blogshots. As as well as changing proportions within the EU28, I wanted to focus upon the fertility rate (ie. how many babies we're having) and the dependency ratio - ie. which countries' labour force have the highest burden upon them.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally; the font. I used Segoe UI throughout this, however I noticed some strange behaviour when I uploaded to Tableau Public - The text boxes, titles, are all Segoe UI, but the axes and labels seem to revert to Times New Roman (or whatever the default font is) - This lead me to change it to Arial, for consistency.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p><p>This is the first time I've used floating components in a dashboard and created a long form viz. While I understand the reason that they are popular, as a designer I don't have the patience or the mindset to regularly create these - particularly given the control (or lack of) that Tableau provides.</p><p><br></p><p>While I can't envision that I'll create a long-form for a long, long while - I'm glad I pushed myself to try something different for this Iron Viz entry; particularly for a topic and story which I am fairly passionate about.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>To view the viz, follow this link; </strong>http://tabsoft.co/2p58rM0</p><p><strong>Or check out the image below.</strong></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W9N1TF87Ggo/WQejUBJEFiI/AAAAAAAABXs/BsWOmYnVGxkKg-9k2PWXRX2mJf2dAEbBwCLcB/s1600/Changing%2BDemographics%2BAcross%2BEurope.png"><img src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-W9N1TF87Ggo/WQejUBJEFiI/AAAAAAAABXs/BsWOmYnVGxkKg-9k2PWXRX2mJf2dAEbBwCLcB/s640/Changing%2BDemographics%2BAcross%2BEurope.png" width="1171" style="max-width: 100%;"></a></div><br><br><p></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><br>
