I've agreed to partake in the Makeover Monday series which Andy Kriebel and Cotgreave will be doing, which hopefully will encourage me to work with different datasets as well as hone the way I think about data visualisation as a whole.&nbsp;<br /><br />If you're also interested in the project, check out Andy's blog post about it <a href="http://vizwiz.blogspot.co.uk/p/makeover-monday-challenges.html" target="_blank">here</a><br /><br />Accepting this challenge, I took it one step further and also attempted to 'blog' my approach to this week's makeover using story points - I've not used story points at all really, and recently was tweeting wondering what ideas people had for good uses.<br /><br />I've come to explain the pro's of using a Story Points system over standalone dashboards and tabbing across as Story Points allowing the user to choose one dashboard and cycle through it, highlighting different aspects as the presenter, well, tells a story.<br /><br />I think this is where Story Points can be powerful - However, I think there's definitely aspects of it which can be honed and amended to ensure that people;<br /><br />a) use it properly and<br />b) are able to harness the full power of Story Points.<br /><br />Andy's post challenges everyone to see what they can do in just an hour; I'll admit I spent just over 2 on this - with about 20-30 more minutes tweaking and then setting up the story points. The formatting itself was the part which took the longest - tidying up tooltips, making sure none of the visuals were overlapping or intruding upon one and other.<br /><br />I'd love to hear and get some feedback on this makeover - Hopefully the first of many to come!<br />Oh, a sidenote - I know jack all about baseball.<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="tableauPlaceholder" style="height: 795px; width: 1204px;"><noscript><a href='#'><img alt=' ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ma&#47;Makeover_1-FiveThirtyEight&#47;TheProcess&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class="tableauViz" height="795" style="display: none;" width="1204"><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='Makeover_1-FiveThirtyEight&#47;TheProcess' /><param name='tabs' value='yes' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;Ma&#47;Makeover_1-FiveThirtyEight&#47;TheProcess&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='showVizHome' value='no' /><param name='showTabs' value='y' /><param name='bootstrapWhenNotified' value='true' /></object></div>
