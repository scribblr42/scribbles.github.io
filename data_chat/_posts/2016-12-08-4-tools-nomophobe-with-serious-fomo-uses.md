<i>So, some of these images are broken, and it's been a few years and I'm not sure what they were.. so.... sorry..</i>

<i>This isn't about productivity in terms of to-do lists, or consolidating thoughts - it's about keeping on top of content you're interested in.</i><br /><br />I'm a self-confessed nomophobe - actually, it goes beyond that I'd say.<br /><br />This is what nomophobia is...<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F9uRnJOnZuY/WEi4ho_ijRI/AAAAAAAABJQ/LqiWpTlYyeYVpR9wl3eigD-S_yUEQRDcgCLcB/s1600/nomo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="234" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F9uRnJOnZuY/WEi4ho_ijRI/AAAAAAAABJQ/LqiWpTlYyeYVpR9wl3eigD-S_yUEQRDcgCLcB/s640/nomo.png" width="640" /></a></div><br />My go-to anecdote on this is that I dropped my phone (at this point, I was on a Nokia 530 - one of those Windows phones) and whilst the screen was being repaired, I was phone-less for the first time in about 5 years. Five years I'd spent with a phone either on my person or within relative reach.<br /><br />And it was seriously weird.<br /><br />Anyway - back to my point. Nomophobia encompasses the sensation that you're lost without your phone. I'd argue I have a serious case of FOMO. What if I miss something? It's not quite anxiety, but I just like knowing... stuff. Think of Johnny Number 5<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9vnOfGSIFWk/WEi5u-ezhJI/AAAAAAAABJY/iBcqsLXwghE83AV6sG1sj9YFOtRL0fkegCLcB/s1600/jn5.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="272" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9vnOfGSIFWk/WEi5u-ezhJI/AAAAAAAABJY/iBcqsLXwghE83AV6sG1sj9YFOtRL0fkegCLcB/s640/jn5.gif" width="640" /></a></div><br />The crux of this blog is this; how does a nomophobe with serious FOMO keep on top of things? I'm going to share 4 "tools" I use to do this.<br /><h2><b>1. Tweetdeck </b><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="https://www.blogger.com/(http://www.tweetdeck.com">(http://www.tweetdeck.com</a>)</span></h2><img height="334" src="https://g.twimg.com/about/products/tweetdeck/HP_screenshot_290_2.png" width="640" /><br /><br />Tweetdeck is awesome. Simply awesome. If you can stand Twitter, and want to take it to one level further, check out Tweetdeck. I stumbled upon it when I was looking for a way to auto-refresh the native Twitter page - This is so much more elegant.<br /><br />a) It's realtime. The latest tweets are at the start, it auto-updates.<br />b) All your streams. At once. You can view your "Home" stream, you can track hashtags (for instance, during the Tableau Conference in Austin, I was tracking the #Data16 tag and had it as a column)<br />c) And with streams, come lists. Come scheduled posts. Comes multi-account management. And it works so so so nicely.<br /><br />The final feature which I like, is scheduled posting, a feature I mentioned above. Being able to stagger posts, re-post at "convenient" times for different time zones is really powerful when attempting to maintain an online presence.<br />Of course, Twitter isn't for everyone. But I like it, and Tweetdeck is my saviour for this.<br /><h2>2. Feedly (<a href="http://www.feedly.com/">http://www.feedly.com</a>)</h2><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pdNCIPeKSLM/WEjC_Vbh4NI/AAAAAAAABJs/_wfin1GsdvkJi3v8YaFBo_sIwPoBdJRpwCLcB/s1600/feedly.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="326" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pdNCIPeKSLM/WEjC_Vbh4NI/AAAAAAAABJs/_wfin1GsdvkJi3v8YaFBo_sIwPoBdJRpwCLcB/s640/feedly.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />For ages, I had no idea what RSS meant. And about a week or so after I found out, Google Reader (largely heralded as the best RSS feed manager around)<br /><br />However, I soon found Feedly. There are two things I like about Feedly. First, is the - you guessed it - feeds. The fact you can great groups of websites/blogs to keep on top of is great. For me, being able to segment economics/financial thought, contemporary tech, as well as data viz and football analytics is priceless. During my placement year, much of the walk was spent catching up on feeds - not so much when I cycled into work though.<br /><br />It's also great for integration &amp; sharing - I rarely use the auto-completed tweet, but it's a nice way to tweet the articles you've read and are interesting. It's not perfect of course - some articles you will have to click through to the website after a sneak preview, while other you'll be able to read the full text of.<br /><br />It's a great tool for curating content you know you regularly read.<br />Which brings me to number three...<br /><h2>3. Pocket (<a href="http://getpocket.com/">http://getpocket.com</a>)</h2><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GkvZPod1hy8/WEjDuC7iVQI/AAAAAAAABJw/jyZHGvvefTwB8h5HE_0eSIGFi6ccd2T-gCLcB/s1600/pock.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="326" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GkvZPod1hy8/WEjDuC7iVQI/AAAAAAAABJw/jyZHGvvefTwB8h5HE_0eSIGFi6ccd2T-gCLcB/s640/pock.png" width="640" /></a></div><div><br /></div><br />Pocket is a great quick, easy way to save content to 'read later' - As long as you keep syncing with your phone, you'll be able to read most of the content offline. I use it to tag posts I want to read, which I don't have time to - It fits nicely with Feedly, as if you're on your computer and you see a blog post which you might miss (due to whatever reason), Pocket is really nice for getting back to stuff you want to read.<br /><br />The best bit, and for me how I use it the most?<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pG0jZsrfTbc/WEjEeBM9tmI/AAAAAAAABJ0/Y2qWfK2_dF8J5UnnpFPtz4D3RoTPmov0ACLcB/s1600/twit.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pG0jZsrfTbc/WEjEeBM9tmI/AAAAAAAABJ0/Y2qWfK2_dF8J5UnnpFPtz4D3RoTPmov0ACLcB/s200/twit.png" width="140" /></a></div><br />Twitter likes.<br />There's a simple IFTTT "applet" (they don't call them recipes anymore...)<br /><br />This does what it says on the tin. And it's superb - How many times have you scrolled through Twitter and liked something as a "I will read you later" action, and not been able to either find it, or simply forgotten?<br /><br />This takes a step for making that not happen. It's handy!<br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>4. Flipboard (<a href="https://flipboard.com/">https://flipboard.com/</a>)</h2><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aHRt7BnWKpA/WEjFjIwkZqI/AAAAAAAABJ8/9k3kDXH75Eo4jy83BLeypHjkg88loWiZQCLcB/s1600/flipboard.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="326" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-aHRt7BnWKpA/WEjFjIwkZqI/AAAAAAAABJ8/9k3kDXH75Eo4jy83BLeypHjkg88loWiZQCLcB/s640/flipboard.png" width="640" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>Let's put it this way - Apple liked Flipboard so much, they created the "News" app. Which is remarkably similar to Flipboard.<br />Flipboard is fantastic.<br /><br />I've used it since the days I had an iPod Touch - You feed it topics that you're interested, and every morning, it populates new content from each of these. And, you guessed it, you flip through stories.<br /><br />I largely use this to keep on top of the wider "real life" stories. This is what I flip through in the mornings while having breakfast.<br /><br /><br /><b>Conclusions</b><br />Mobile has changed the way we consume content - indeed, it's helped us curate our content to stuff that we believe in, so we feel empowered.<br />Of course, your feed of content and data is as good as the funnel you create.<br /><br />Am I missing any? What are apps or website which you use to keep on top of things?
